                    <p>Am Twenty one. Administrator.Rwandan.Fashion Enthusiast. Daydreamer. I like adventure, Poetry, stylish people, vintage clothing,
                    surprises, and of course good food. I think in my next life, I’ll probably be a true free spirit. I’ll travel the world,
                    take pictures, write down some notes and make beautiful memories.I hope to still do all those things in this life! I am an
                    ambitious and optimist girl who believes in destiny I am a feminist who focus on what she wants and make sure to get it.
                    I Love Fashion I’m inspired by creativity and uniqueness. I love people who stand out in a crowd, who have a sense of individuality.
                    I believe that’s what fashion and personal style is all about. Infusing that little part of you and creating your own statement.
                    I Love Poetry, Words and Movies There’s this unexplainable feeling I get when i read something extremely beautiful, be it
                    poetry or Prose. I feel it within every inch of my being. I Love the little things of life that make me smile, regardless
                    Hugs, holding hands, little notes, beautiful places, flowers, smell of a perfume , time with family and friends, Laughter,
                    pictures, beautiful memories. I am learning every day to live and let live, to let go of the past and focus more on what’s
                    in front, to love, to laugh more, give more, be more, to be thankful for the little things, to be totally and unashamedly
                    Me. But most importantly to allow the space between where I am and where I want to be to inspire and not terrify me.” This
                    is my little corner on the web to share my personal life style</p>
